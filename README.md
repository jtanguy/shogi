shogi
=====

After seeing several live game coding adventures like *Haskell Live*[^1] or *Tetrix in Scala*[^2], I decided to give it a try.

I decided to focus on a game I just recently learned: Shogi.

Shogi is often described as japanese chess, but in my opinion is is a totally different game.
Basic info on the game can be found at [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogi).

Objectives
----------
The objectives are still unclear, but I have some things in mind for this game simulator:

- Provide a console interface to play the game against another player.
- Load and save capabilities in order to replay or resume games, using a [standard notation](http://www.japanesechess.net/psn/).
- GUI

I may decide, at a later point, to use the [Universal Shogi Interface](http://www.glaurungchess.com/shogi/usi.html).

Some things are also on my wontdo list:

- Gaming AI. I am still a newbie in this game, and while I understand the rules, I cannot make a decent AI.
